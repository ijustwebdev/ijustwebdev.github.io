# My current portfolio page
  This is my most recent page I've created. It's a simple site that serves to host some information about me, a few of the most recent small projects I've done, and provides some links to get into contact with me. This is my first attempt at creating a responsive website.

  I used HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript to create what I have right now as well as [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) and [anime.js](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime/) to handle animations. In the future I want to add more animations to the page to allow elements to come into view with a bit more excitement but also to do so in a way that is visually pleasing. I also have considered using React but I haven't come across anything that would require it so I've kinda put that off. This page is sort of a testing playground for me to learn in and hopefully leave in a state that's presentable. 

  I'm still trying to get a better grasp of responsive design and as you will see there are a lot of design mistakes and a lot more dirty fixes in this project. 
  
  Overall it has been a really fun project that has brought my attention to flexbox and grid, my IDE shortcuts, and git as well as the concept of mobile first development and responsive design tricks and challenges. In the future I want to work on creating cleaner HTML files, using Javascript libraries and creating more element dense pages.
